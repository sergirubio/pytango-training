# Review of SKA guidelines for TANGO devices

All Tango Device Servers in SKA projects are expected to inherit 
from the SKABaseDevice parent class.

This template device overrides Tango logging mechanims to use 
python logging instead.

So, instead of the 4 basic loggins in Tango managed by shell argument (-v4); 
SKA devices will display the following logs:
  OFF, FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG

The LoggingLevel attribute and LoggingLevelDefault will control the current
output of the logging system.

It also adds several attributes, initializing them using enumerations
defined within SKA project:

```
        self._version_id = release.version
        self._health_state = HealthState.OK
        self._admin_mode = AdminMode.ONLINE
        self._control_mode = ControlMode.REMOTE
        self._simulation_mode = SimulationMode.FALSE
        self._test_mode = TestMode.NONE
```
In addition, a Reset() command should allow to reinitialize the device without calling
Init() command (that may reset several internal variables unintentionally).

## Reusing classes that do not belong to SKA  project

Example, using the PySocket class from https://github.com/alba-synchrotron/PySocket

It can be added to an existing device by modifying the main method.
