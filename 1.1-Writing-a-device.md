# Writing a TANGO device class (Python)

Concepts that will be explored:

 * Adding commands
 * Modifying device state
 * Adding attributes
 * Attribute alarm ranges
 * Implications of polling/events

## Writing Python Tango Devices using both classical API and Python HL API

### Exercise 1: Write A Tango Device Server for a Fixed Voltage Power Supply following this specification. (The device is loosely based on the Power Supply device that appears on the PyTango HL documentation).

#### States

 * ON: Output is enabled
 * OFF: Output is disabled (although attributes are readable)
 * RUNNING: A setting is being applied (will make sense in a later exercise)
 
#### Commands

 * On : enables the output, current is calcullated taking voltage and load impedance into account.
 * Off : disables the output, current is 0
 
#### Attributes

 * Voltage : writable by user, needs some time to be updated on HW
 * Current: calcullated by the device when state is ON
 
#### Properties

 * LoadImpedance: DevDouble: in this example it will be the impedance of the load connected to the power supply.
 * HWReadtime: Time needed to change a parameter on HW
 
### Running the device inside a composer

    cd /usr/src/ska-docker/docker-compose
    make start itango
    docker cp -r ~/pytango-training/FixedVoltagePowerSupply itango:/home/tango/
