# Writing a TANGO device class (Python)

Concepts that will be explored:

 * One 
 * Two
 * Three

# Writing Python Tango Devices using both classical API and Python HL API

## Exercise 1: Write A Tango Device Server for a Fixed Voltage Power Supply following this specification. (The device is loosely based on the Power Supply device that appears on the PyTango HL documentation).




A DevDouble property: Load: in this example it will be the impidance of the load connected to the power supply.

2 Attributes: Writable voltage and Readable Current.

2 Commands: On and Off.

 * Properties: Configuration variables, stored in the Tango Database

 * Attributes: 

 * Commands:
 
### Running the device inside a composer

    cd /usr/src/ska-docker/docker-compose
    make start itango
    docker cp -r ~/pytango-training/FixedVoltagePowerSupply itango:/home/tango/

## Devices to be writen
 * Single class device
 * Multi class device
 * Single-device device server instance
 * Multi-device device server instance	
	*	Power supply device
	*	Socket device.
