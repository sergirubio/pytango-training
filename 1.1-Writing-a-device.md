# Writing a TANGO device class (Python)

Concepts that will be explored:

 * Adding commands
 * Modifying device state
 * Adding attributes
 * Attribute alarm ranges
 * Implications of polling/events

## Writing Python Tango Devices using both classical API and Python HL API

### Exercise 1: Write A Tango Device Server for a Fixed Voltage Power Supply following this specification. (The device is loosely based on the Power Supply device that appears on the PyTango HL documentation).

The Device Server that we are going to create will simulate a Voltage Power Supply. When setting On() the Voltage written by user will be applied on a LoadImpedance, resulting in a Current reading readable by clients.

#### Properties

 * LoadImpedance: DevDouble: in this example it will be the impedance of the load connected to the power supply.
 * HWReadtime: Time needed to change a parameter on HW
 
#### States

 * ON: Output is enabled
 * OFF: Output is disabled (although attributes are readable)
 * RUNNING: A setting is being applied (will make sense in a later exercise)
 
#### Commands

 * On : enables the output, current is calcullated taking voltage and load impedance into account.
 * Off : disables the output, current is 0
 
#### Attributes

 * Voltage : writable by user, needs some time to be updated on HW (Units in Volts)
 * Current: calcullated by the device when state is ON (Units in Ampers)
 
## Executing Pogo from a container

    cd /usr/src/ska-docker/docker-compose
    make start pogo
    
Design your device using the Pogo Helper Tool

![Pogo Power Supply](https://github.com/sergirubio/pytango-training/blob/master/images/pogo_power_supply.png)

Proceed to create the described Properties, Commands and Attributes.

When done, proceed to create the device in Jive and launch it from shell.

 
## Creating and executing the device

We will launch the Jive application

    cd /usr/src/ska-docker/docker-compose
    make start jive

From there, we will go to "Add new device" in the menu with the following parameters

     Server: PowerSupply/1
     Class: PowerSupply
     Devices: test/ps/1

Now we can launch the device, either locally or using the itango container.
 
#### Running the device inside a container

    cd /usr/src/ska-docker/docker-compose
    
Add these lines to itango.yml

    # sudo gedit itango.yml

    volumes:
      - ${HOME}:/hosthome:rw

Then, launch the container and run the device:

    make start itango
    docker exec -it /hosthome/PowerSupply.py -?

#### Running the device in the virtual machine

This option is far more comfortable, but we will not be using nor python3 nor 
the latest versions of packages (not relevant for the training).

   > sudo apt-get update
   > sudo apt install python-tango
   > python PowerSupply.py
   
----

### Exercise 2:  Implementation of the Device. Insert the described behaviour in Exercise 1 into the PROTECTED AREAS of the generated template.

These methods will be useful:

 * Modify the state: self.set_state(DevState.ON)
  * (you may use ipython to check the valid values of DevState)

 * generate an sleep within the code:  time.sleep(seconds)

----

### Exercise 3: Setup polling for State, Units for Current and Voltage, Max and Min valid values for Voltage, Alarm Ranges for Current.

Use the different context menus in pogo  to setup state and attributes:

![Pogo Power Supply](https://github.com/sergirubio/pytango-training/blob/master/images/pogo_alarm_ranges.png)

Once everything is setup:

* regenerate the code. 
* Check if your previous implementation was destroyed (ups!). 
* Execute the following code in a shell:

```
cd /usr/src/ska-docker/docker-compose
docker exec -it itango ipython3
```

#### Showing the PowerSuplly current changes

Using a generic Event callback

```
import tango
from tango.client import Device
dev = Device('test/ps/1')
cb = tango.utils.EventCallback()

eis = [dev.subscribe_event(a,tango.EventType.CHANGE_EVENT,cb) for a in ('Current','State')]

#... play with your device

[dev.unsubscribe_event(e) for e in eis]
```

Writing your own custom callback
```
dev = Device('test/ps/1')

def callback(event):
    print(event.get_date(),event.device,event.attr_name)
    if event.err:
        print('error received!')
    else:
        print('value',event.attr_value.value)

ei = dev.subscribe_event('Current',tango.EventType.CHANGE_EVENT,callback)

dev.Current = 10

dev.unsubscribe_event(ei)
```

### Exercise 4: Playing with the device

* Explore the management of polling/events from Jive.

* Modify the properties, what is needed to update them?

* Increase the HWReadtime ... what is the effect?

* Access the device from ATKPanel and ipython, what is the effect?
