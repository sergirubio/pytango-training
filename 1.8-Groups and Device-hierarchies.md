Groups can be easily created from ipython / iTango

# Device Hierarchies

## Exercise 10: Create a new device server with 2 classes, PowerSupply and SKAPowerSupply. Declare a device for each one and Run it. Create another server running 5 SKAPowerSupply devices.

The Server to launch 2 classes is as simple as:

# PyTango imports

from PyTango import DebugIt
from PyTango.server import run

from FixedCurrentPowerSupply import FixedCurrentPowerSupply
from SKAPowerSupply import SKAPowerSupply

# ----------
# Run server
# ----------


def main(args=None, **kwargs):
    # PROTECTED REGION ID(FixedCurrentPowerSupply.main) ENABLED START #
    return run((FixedCurrentPowerSupply,SKAPowerSupply), args=args, **kwargs)
    # PROTECTED REGION END #    //  FixedCurrentPowerSupply.main

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Exercise 11: We are going to create a "SKAComposerDevice". Inheriting from SKABaseDevice, with a DeviceList property to specify a list of devices, and three spectrum attributes: Currents, Voltages and States, to show up the states of all the devices listed.

For this device two implementations of the TangoGroup are going to be tested. First one based on read_asynch / read_reply commands.

## Exercise 12: Re-implement the previous device but adding MaxVoltage and MaxCurrent attributes. This  time, use event subscribing and callbacks to update the values of the attributes.
