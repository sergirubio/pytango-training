Some advantages of "classic" api.

 - Dynamic Attributes are easier to implement, as "attr" object 
passed as argument allow to identify attributes by name.

 - Dynamic Commands implemented only on classic API

 - read_attr_hardware exists only on classic API, allows to treat
attribute reading and command execution separately.

 - separate __init__ device allows to separate creation of variables
that should be done only once from those done at each Init() call.
