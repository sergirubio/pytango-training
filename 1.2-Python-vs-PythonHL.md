# "Classic" Python API vs Python HL

Some advantages of "HL" API:

  - Much less overhead on writing device servers and clients.

 - Python properties and decorators allow a much more compact syntax.

 - More readable code allows a better understanding of the behaviour.

Some advantages of "classic" ap:

 - Dynamic Attributes are easier to implement, as "attr" object 
passed as argument allow to identify attributes by name.

 - Dynamic Commands implemented only on classic API

 - read_attr_hardware exists only on classic API, allows to treat
attribute reading and command execution separately.
- (but you can still write your own custom read_attr_hardware if you want)

 - separate __init__ device allows to separate creation of variables
that should be done only once from those done at each Init() call. 
(making unnecessary to have a Reset() command).
  - (but you can still write your own custom __init__ if you want)

 - classic Python API allow to load device server written in either
 C++, Python or PythonHL. PythonHL servers only can run PythonHL classes.
