## Exercise 10: Create a device server running 5 SKAPowerSupply devices. Manage all 5 power supplies together as a group.



# Device Hierarchies

## Exercise 11: Create a new device server with 2 classes, PowerSupply and SKAPowerSupply. Declare a device for each one and Run it. 

The Server to launch 2 classes is as simple as:

def main(args=None, **kwargs):
    # PROTECTED REGION ID(FixedCurrentPowerSupply.main) ENABLED START #

    # PROTECTED REGION END #    //  FixedCurrentPowerSupply.main

    main()
```

## Exercise 11: We are going to create a "SKAComposerDevice". Inheriting from SKABaseDevice, with a DeviceList property to specify a list of devices, and three spectrum attributes: Currents, Voltages and States, to show up the states of all the devices listed.

For this device two implementations of the TangoGroup are going to be tested. First one based on read_asynch / read_reply commands.

## Exercise 12: Re-implement the previous device but adding MaxVoltage and MaxCurrent attributes. This  time, use event subscribing and callbacks to update the values of the attributes.
