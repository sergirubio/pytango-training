## Polling from Clients vs Polling from Server vs Pushing Events

* A completely lazy implementation will consist on letting the client to ask periodically the values it wants.
  * Advantages, nothing is done if nobody wants it
  * Disadvantage, many clients will easily saturate the device
  
* Using Tango Polling, clients only access cached values or receive events
  * Advantages, most efficient, you protect the device from external clients
  * Disadvantages, the device is running continuously, any memory leak will be magnified, the device becomes sensible to serialization issues (if not giving time to process all pollings)
  
* Pushing events manually from the code
  * Typically updating attribute values from a single command execution (Update()) or a background thread.
  * It can be combined with the previous approach
  * Not as easily configurable from Jive (if used, it may introduce performance issues)
  * Even if using a background thread, it does not scape serialization completely (event pushing is blocking)

## Pushing events from Class (device) code

To configure an attribute to be pushed:

 * On init_device: 
 ```
 self.set_change_event('Current',True,False) #Push manually, ignore Jive config
 ```
 
 * On your methods: 
 ```
 self.push_change_event('Current',value) # [timestamp, quality]
 ```
 
 ## Exercise 5
 
 Modify your existing device server to push Current events manually instead of using polling
 
 ## Exercise 6
 
 Add a  RampingSteps property and this method to your device to Ramp the current values:
 
 ```
     def ramp_current(self,start, end):
        step = float(end-start)/self.RampingSteps                                                        
        self.set_state(DevState.RUNNING)
        for i in range(self.RampingSteps):
            time.sleep(1.)
            self.current += step
            self.push_change_event('Current',self.current)
            print(self.current)
        self.set_state(DevState.ON)
 ```
